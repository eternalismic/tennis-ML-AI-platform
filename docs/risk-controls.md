# Risk Controls

- **Edge threshold (\(\tau\))**: margin of safety against noise & miscalibration.
- **Stake cap (\(f_{max}\))**: limits per-bet risk.
- **Daily stop-loss / take-profit**: circuit breakers.
- **Exposure limit**: cap unmatched liability.
- **Kill-switch**: manual or automated disable on anomalies.
