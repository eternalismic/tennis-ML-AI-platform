# Validation â€” Backtests & Shadow Runs

1. **Historical backtests**: replay markets, compute decisions & P/L.
2. **Shadow (SIM) runs**: real-time, paper trading with live odds.
3. **Tournament sweeps**: threshold grid-search for robust \(\tau\).
4. **A/B variants**: compare model versions with common random numbers.
5. **Guardrails**: stop-loss, max daily bets, exposure caps.

**Outputs**: ROI distribution, win rate, EV stability, drawdowns, sensitivity to \(\tau\).
